# 👋 Hi, I’m @omsali

- I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), specializing in building scalable, event-driven systems and production-grade infrastructure. My engineering philosophy centers on reliability, observability, and cost-efficiency.
- Currently, I am focused on architecting fault-tolerant microservices using Java (Spring Boot), Apache Kafka, and AWS.

## 🔍 What I Work On

- Distributed Systems: Event-driven architectures, fault tolerance, and consistency patterns.
- Backend Infrastructure: High-throughput APIs, database optimization, and caching strategies.
- ML Infrastructure: Scalable data pipelines and distributed training workflows (Spark/EMR).
- Observability: Real-time telemetry, monitoring, and system resilience.


##  🛠️ Tech Stack

- Languages: C++, Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript/TypeScript
- Core Concepts: Algorithms & Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, System Design, SDLC
- Web/Backend: React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, REST API, FastAPI, gRPC, Socket.io
- Data & Infra	Apache Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, InfluxDB, AWS (EC2, S3, EMR)
- DevOps	Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Kong API Gateway
- Observability	Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Grafana Tempo
- ML/Data: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Regression, Classification, Random forest
- Tools: Git/GitHub, Docker
- Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Postgres
